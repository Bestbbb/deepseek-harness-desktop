## Choose your model.

Configure DeepSeek, other supported providers, or an OpenAI-compatible gateway. Your provider handles inference and billing.

## A desktop app with room to extend.

Harness owns the agent runtime. Tauri supplies the native window and operating-system integration.

<div class="dsh-extension-grid"><div>

### Native where it matters

System WebView, native menus, keyboard shortcuts, runtime supervision, and diagnostic export. No bundled Electron or Chromium.

### Plugins at the core

Use Cordis plugins, Agent presets, skills, and MCP integrations. Optional Codex and Claude Code bundles add delegated agents after setup.

## Start with a local project.

1. **Install.** Choose the macOS Apple Silicon or Windows x64 installer from the release assets.
2. **Connect.** Configure your model provider in Settings, using its supported authentication method.
3. **Work.** Choose a workspace and an Agent preset, then describe your task.

<div class="dsh-preview-note">

### Before you install

This is a community preview, not an official DeepSeek product. macOS previews are ad-hoc signed and not notarized; Windows previews are unsigned. Check each release's platform notes and bundled version.

Local execution is not offline inference. Plugins and external agents run code; review permissions before granting workspace access. Automatic updates are not configured.
