# Agent Note: A Bundle marketplace for non-developer desktop users

Status: proposed

English | [中文](2026-09-06-desktop-plugin-marketplace.zh.md)

## Problem

The desktop extension directory and data-only Skill installer do not manage installable Cordis capabilities. Users need a discoverable path from a task-oriented listing to a configured, working plugin without installing development tools or editing composition files. Independent native preferences and a read-only Harness inventory cannot serve as two authoritative installation states.

## Proposal

Use installable Profile Bundles as the distribution unit. A marketplace entry adds publisher, purpose, screenshots, license, reviewed artifact identity, supported platform/Host combinations, and configuration guidance; package dependencies and Cordis rows stay in the existing package manifest and Bundle patch. Skills and MCP integrations are capabilities a Bundle can compose, not the whole marketplace.

A Cordis plugin-management service should own desired installations and operations, with providers for the reviewed catalog and package-manager execution and a browser consumer for discovery, configuration, installed state, and updates. Split packages only where these roles evolve independently. Runtime observations must remain separate from desired enablement. Tauri retains startup, process supervision, OS operations, application updates, and recovery when plugins fail.

## Delivery sequence

1. Validate packaged external Host and client activation with no developer PATH. The [packaging implementation](../../implemented/architecture/2026-09-06-desktop-bundle-packaging.md) supplies the pinned tool and offline smoke; it is not a marketplace service.
2. Add reviewed catalog parsing, compatibility decisions, operation records, candidate dependency preparation, and controlled activation after active tasks finish. [Local byte preparation](../../implemented/architecture/2026-09-06-reviewed-bundle-preparation.md), [offline dependencies](../../implemented/architecture/2026-09-06-offline-bundle-candidates.md), [candidate Profile composition](../../implemented/architecture/2026-09-07-candidate-profile-composition.md), and [native next-launch activation with startup-failure recovery](../../implemented/architecture/2026-09-07-desktop-profile-startup-selection.md) are implemented. Active-task restart coordination remains pending. Preserve the previous usable composition. Recovery must never overwrite committed Session generations or imply supported data downgrades.
3. Add a unified browser entry with discovery, installed inventory, version changes and operation history. The [browser implementation](../../implemented/architecture/2026-09-07-desktop-marketplace-browser.md) supplies local metadata search, explicit replacement review and read-only preparation records. Focus Timer, Notification Controls and Delegate Tasks have keyed use actions. Public feed deployment and plugin-owned configuration/login readiness remain pending; neither an installed version nor a prepared receipt proves readiness.
4. Deliver three reviewed examples spanning UI, task behavior, and agent collaboration. The account-free [Focus Timer](../../implemented/feature/2026-09-07-focus-timer-bundle.md), [Notification Controls](../../implemented/feature/2026-09-07-notification-controls-bundle.md) and [Delegate Tasks](../../../../packages/desktop/delegation-launcher/README.md) supply these examples. The [author guide](../../../../docs/cookbook/desktop-marketplace-bundle.md), GitHub proposal form and read-only publication checker support review; an independent publisher scaffold and self-service distribution remain pending.
5. Validate native installers, signed application updates, first-task onboarding, and long-session performance with non-developer participants before general release. Arbitrary publisher submissions and stronger isolation are later decisions.

## Open-market completion work

The curated marketplace is not a completed open marketplace. Complete the following in dependency order; each item needs its own implementation and acceptance evidence.

1. Use the owner-approved GitHub PR review and static-hosting model, without a platform account system. Define code approval, catalog publication and unsafe-release response in the maintainer workflow before publishing an external trust source.
2. Deploy the [signed catalog implementation](../../implemented/architecture/2026-09-13-signed-marketplace-catalog.md), which supplies bounded HTTPS reads, expiry, cached revision checks and review-token confirmation. Define signing-key custody and rotation, publish the reviewed feed, and wire pinned public trust into packaged desktop configuration. These deployment steps remain incomplete; a checksum beside an untrusted download is not authentication.
3. Publish a shared web catalog and author toolkit. Project reviewed metadata without a second source of truth; add source-pinned submissions, packaging templates, compatibility evidence and maintainer release procedures. A public website can browse metadata but must not control a local runtime without its authentication and explicit user consent.
4. Complete install-to-use readiness. Let each Bundle declare configuration/login needs and contribute its own setup/use UI; store secrets through credentials. Add task-aware restart coordination without auto-running inference or claiming a prepared package is healthy.
5. Operate releases safely. Define listing retirement and compromised-artifact handling without silently deleting user code or data. Produce updated desktop assets and website deployment, keep signing and notarization claims accurate, and test packaged installation/recovery plus native windows on supported platforms.
6. Measure and verify the product. Record cold startup, idle process-tree memory, marketplace search latency and long-session behavior before setting budgets. Run first-install, version-change, offline, corruption, interrupted-install and recovery scenarios with non-developer users. Stronger per-plugin isolation remains a separately scoped security capability, not a permission-label feature.

## Alternatives considered

**Make Skills and MCP templates the primary marketplace model.** Rejected because this excludes UI and control-flow capabilities supported by Cordis.

**Move every desktop responsibility into plugins.** Rejected because application startup and recovery must remain available when the plugin runtime fails.

**Open arbitrary npm installation with permission checkboxes.** Rejected because same-process Host plugins do not currently have enforced per-plugin isolation. A declared permission list is not a sandbox.

## Acceptance criteria

- A supported clean machine installs a reviewed Bundle without Node, pnpm, a compiler, or manual configuration edits.
- A real external package contributes both Host behavior and browser UI; removal retracts both after controlled restart.
- Failed installation, interrupted application, incompatible versions, and failed activation preserve a recoverable composition and user data.
- Secrets stay in the credentials service. Real-model checks require explicit invocation and disclose possible account usage.
- Publisher provenance, artifact verification, update trust, and application signing have distinct verification paths.
- Native macOS and Windows acceptance complements focused unit, packaged-runtime, browser, and failure tests; mocks alone do not establish compatibility.

## Risks

Host APIs are pre-stable, so tested combinations constrain publication. Native dependencies need platform-specific prebuilt artifacts. Package-manager scripts, hooks, and inherited configuration require explicit controls. Reviewed code remains trusted code; future process isolation does not automatically restrict filesystem access. Safe recovery can restore code/configuration only when plugin data compatibility permits it. Performance budgets need measured startup, process-tree memory, input latency, and long-session baselines before they become release gates.
