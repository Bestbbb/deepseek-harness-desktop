# Desktop host

English | [中文](desktop.zh.md)

The desktop subsystem is an optional [capability seam](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-06-13-capability-seams.md) between a Harness Host and the native application that owns its process. The Service Definition ([dsh-desktop](../../packages/desktop/desktop)) exposes only `ctx.desktop`; the authenticated loopback Service Provider ([dsh-desktop-native](../../packages/desktop/desktop-native)) forwards that narrow contract to the Tauri host. Browser and headless compositions do not load either package.

## Boundary

The marketplace declares the root keyed slot `settings.bundleMarketplace.action` for plugin-owned use controls. Its key is the installed npm package name; its owner props reuse `SettingsPluginsTabOwnerProps`, including the Settings shell's `close` callback. Only confirmed-version entries in the selected Profile render these contributions outside a startup trial. The [marketplace reference](../../packages/desktop/bundle-marketplace/README.md#implementation) owns registration semantics; native startup does not interpret these browser actions.

The optional [marketplace plugin](../../packages/desktop/bundle-marketplace/README.md) exposes browser commands over the existing authenticated Remote transport. `MarketplaceEntry` projects catalog identity, title, package/version, publisher, source and compatibility issues without artifact paths. `MarketplaceSnapshot` combines these entries with native `DesktopProfileSelection` and `MarketplaceProfile` observations. Each Profile is either `unavailable` or `read` with ordered `ProfileBundle` values containing `packageName` and a nullable resolved `version`; these are file observations, not running-plugin health. `MarketplaceCommandResult` distinguishes `acknowledged` from `unconfirmed`, which requires a fresh read before retrying. The browser contribution mounts its own Remote namespace and Settings tab without changing the base Web assembly.

`ProfileBundle.removable` identifies a confirmed direct dependency resolved inside its Profile, excluding installation-owned, indirect and external packages. Removal commands carry the observed active Profile, package name and version; the Host rechecks these observations before preparing a new composition.

The separate [Bundle preparation service](../../packages/desktop/bundle-preparation/README.md) runs in Cordis, not in the native host. Its receipts describe reviewed bytes, offline dependencies or validated Profile composition. Its explicit activation operation prepares a fresh generation and queues it through the native desktop capability; the native host owns startup confirmation and recovery.

Its [types](../../packages/desktop/bundle-preparation/src/types.ts) distinguish the catalog-issued `BundleCatalogId`, a `BundleCandidate` containing compatibility findings, a `PreparedBundle` with verified artifact metadata and staging paths, and `PreparedDependencies` with private candidate, installed package, lockfile and receipt paths. Their states are `prepared-not-enabled` and `dependencies-prepared-not-enabled`; neither proves runtime readiness or publisher identity.

`PreparedComposition` records the candidate Harness home and Profile, a refreshed Profile lockfile, composed YAML and a source-configuration fingerprint. Validation-only candidates use a private home; activation candidates use an independent Profile in the existing desktop home. `composition-checked-not-enabled` means the normal dsh launcher composed the copied layers without booting them; it is not an active installation or runtime health result.

`PreparedRemoval` retains the composition paths and fingerprint without a dependency-installation candidate. It carries `removed.packageName`, `removed.version` and state `removal-checked-not-enabled`. It proves boot-free validation of a copied Profile with that direct Bundle removed, not deletion from the active Profile or erasure of plugin data.

`BundleOperationId` identifies one preparation attempt. `PreparationOperation` reports its optional catalog metadata or `removed` package/version, requested `PreparationKind`, start time and observed state: `preparing`, `unsettled`, `prepared`, `failed`, `unreadable` or `unavailable`. `PreparationKind` includes `removal` independently of catalog artifact stages. `preparedState` identifies a completed preparation stage, not an active installation. The [package reference](../../packages/desktop/bundle-preparation/README.md#operation-history) owns history semantics and retention limits.

The seam reports whether the native host is reachable and exposes window activation, operating-system notifications, and login autostart. It does not expose an arbitrary native command channel, filesystem escape hatch, session data, settings, or credentials. A provider rejects operations that the host cannot complete instead of silently emulating them in Node.js.

`DesktopProfileName` is a branded native Profile name. `DesktopProfileCandidate` carries `profile`, expected `previousProfile` and `manifestSha256`. `DesktopProfileSelection` has `schemaVersion: 1`, an `activeProfile`, nullable `previousProfile`, nullable `pending` and `trial` candidates, and nullable `lastFailure` with a candidate and `interrupted`, `startup-failed` or `invalid-candidate` reason. These identities support next-launch queueing and exact cancellation; neither pending nor trial state means an active installation.

The desktop composition gives trusted Host plugins access to this capability. Per-plugin principals and per-call permission grants are deferred; consumers must therefore remain part of the trusted application composition.

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).
